# Hello World! Call me Ju :D

Hey! I'm 19 years old, I'm a Christian and I love everything that involves technology, especially development ❤

I started my studies alone at home with my father's computer, and now I'm a student at College 42, down there I left a paragraph about this incredible and futuristic school!

- 👽 I’m currently study at 42
- 👩‍💻 I’m currently work at Vaxxinova
- ✨ I'm Dev Back-End and some other things ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love all Quentin Tarantino movies
### 🤔 Any questions? You can call me!

### `42 BORN TO CODE ?`

42 is the first computer training **completely free, open to all without qualification requirements and accessible from 18 years old**. Its pedagogy is based on **peer-to-peer learning**: a participatory operation, without lessons, without a teacher, which allows students to unleash all their creativity through project-based learning. 42 was founded on the initiative of Xavier Niel in 2013 when the digital industry in France suffered from a serious shortage of IT developers. To train the best talents of tomorrow in large numbers, the establishment provides the best infrastructure in innovative and modern locations in Paris and Fremont (Silicon Valley). And recently, 42 have launched internationally with 29 campuses for 2020 including 4 in France, Belgium, Morocco, Finland, Netherlands, Russia, Brazil, Armenia, Japan, Spain, Canada, Italy , Portugal, Thailand, Germany, Jordan, Malaysia, Australia, Abu Dhabi.
**42, is our answer to what the school of tomorrow should be.**
